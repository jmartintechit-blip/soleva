You note once how your money comes in and goes out (salary, contributions, fixed expenses) and Soleva proposes your balances every month and shows where you will be in 5, 10 or 20 years. Built for young investors in Spain with several accounts, funds or brokers. The app is in Spanish.

> Soleva does not move money, does not connect to your bank and does not recommend products. Every projection is an estimate, not advice.

## Features

Today (blocks 0 to 6, plus blocks 8 to 10 without screens):

- Public home page with a compound interest calculator in today's euros (3, 6 and 8 % scenarios, 2.5 % inflation).
- Waitlist with consent and email double opt-in (open).
- Legal notice, terms of use and privacy policy.
- Passwordless sign-in with a 6-digit code by email.
- Private routes behind a session, bottom navigation on mobile and a sidebar on desktop.
- Accounts and rules: create, edit, pause, archive and delete; a New rule sheet with templates.
- Rules and month-by-month projection engine by scenario, with invariant tests.
- Home and Projection: net worth, history, scenarios, horizon, what-ifs, editable assumptions and the on-track light.
- Month close: balances proposed from your rules, inline correction, confirmation, history with amendments and an email reminder.
- Settings: three themes, reminder, export everything as JSON or CSV, end sessions and delete the account for real.
- Horizonte dark design system with self-hosted fonts.
- Ledger database (v0.8.0), daily engine (v0.9.0) and data and daily runs (v0.10.0): movements generated every day, interest on the real balance, debts, dividends, valuation, returns, alerts, stock closes, ECB rates, the official Euribor and Hacienda's car tables; no screens yet.

Coming before the beta: Soleva will keep track of your money on its own, movement by movement. You enter your situation once and every day it generates transfers, your plans' purchases, interest, payments and dividends, and values your holdings.

## Stack

TypeScript · SvelteKit 3 + Svelte 5 · Cloudflare Workers · Neon Postgres (Frankfurt) with hand-written SQL · Better Auth · Resend · Zod · Vitest + PGlite · Playwright.

Details in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (Spanish).

## Run it locally

You need Node 24 and a [Neon](https://neon.tech) database (free).

```bash
npm ci
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars   # the app: DATABASE_URL and BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
cp .env.example .env             # the scripts: DATABASE_URL
npm run migrate
npm run dev
```

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: a random string of 32 characters or more (`openssl rand -base64 32`).
- `WAITLIST_OPEN=1` shows the waitlist form (still off in production).
- `ALLOWED_EMAILS`: comma-separated emails that may sign in (empty = nobody; sign-up is closed until the beta).
- Without `RESEND_API_KEY`, the sign-in code is printed in the `npm run dev` console.
- `npm test` needs no keys: it uses in-memory Postgres (PGlite).
- `npm run check` runs lint, types, format, tests and build, like CI.
- `npm run e2e` tests with Playwright sign-in, the waitlist, the calculator, accounts and rules, projection, month close and settings against the `.env` branch (with `delivered@resend.dev` in `ALLOWED_EMAILS`); CI runs it on a throwaway Neon branch copied from dev.

## Status

Under construction: blocks 0 to 6 and 8 to 10 done (v0.10.0), deployed with sign-up closed and the waitlist open. Polish (block 7) moves to the end, on the new screens. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
